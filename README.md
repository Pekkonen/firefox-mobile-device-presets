# Firefox Mobile Device Presets
Mobile device presets for the Firefox [responsive design view](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_View).

## Installation

In Firefox, open a new tab and navigate to `about:config`. In the search bar, search for `devtools.responsiveUI.presets`. Edit the entry (or create it if it doesn't exist yet) and replace the value with the contents of `mobile-device-presets.json`.

## Usage

Open the responsive design view through the developer tools dialog box, Firefox menu `Extra -> Web Developer -> Responsive Design View`, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Alt + Cmd + M` on Mac or `Ctrl + Shift + M` on Windows.

## Contributing

If you would like to help out with the project, we're looking for people to test the accuracy of the device presets. In order to test a device, please [open an issue for it](https://github.com/robneu/firefox-mobile-device-presets/issues/) if one doesn't already exist. Testing a device means comparing the visual representation of a website within the Firefox responsive design view to the actual display of a real, physical device.

If the results are inaccurate, please provide as much data as possible about the innaruacies such as screenshots, measurement data, and anything else you think will be helpful to getting a more accurate result.
